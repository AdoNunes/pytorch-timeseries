# Data

Data for the experiments should live here. This folder serves as a placeholder - the location of the data folder is a
parameter which can be passed to the trainer.

The `Trainer` expects the [UCR archive](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/) to be saved here with an
unchanged folder name (i.e. `UCR_TS_Archive_2015`).
